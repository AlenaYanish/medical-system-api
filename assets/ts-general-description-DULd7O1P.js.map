Product Perspective\n\nThe Web Application Postprocessor is a single-page application (SPA) built with React. It serves as the primary interface for end-users to interact with medical data sourced from the Medical System API. It will run directly in modern web browsers and will communicate with the API via standard HTTP/S requests. The application focuses on data presentation, manipulation, and analysis within the browser environment, leveraging the backend API for data persistence and core business logic.\n\n## 2.2. Product Functions\n\nThe core functions of the Web Application Postprocessor include:\n* **User Interface (UI) Presentation:** Rendering intuitive and responsive user interfaces for data display and interaction.\n* **Authentication and Authorization:** Managing user sessions and ensuring access control within the web application, often by interacting with the Medical System API's authentication endpoints.\n* **Data Retrieval & Display:** Fetching raw medical data from the Medical System API and displaying it in various formats (e.g., tables, charts, lists).\n* **Data Post-processing:** Applying specific algorithms or transformations on the client-side to raw data retrieved from the API, based on user input or predefined rules. This might include statistical calculations, filtering, or aggregation for visualization purposes.\n* **Interactive Data Filtering & Sorting:** Providing tools within the UI for users to dynamically filter, sort, and search through displayed data.\n* **Data Visualization:** Presenting processed data using various visual components (e.g., graphs, charts) to facilitate analysis.\n* **Data Export:** Allowing users to export processed data in common formats (e.g., CSV, PDF).\n\n## 2.3. User Characteristics\n\nThe primary users of this Web Application Postprocessor are **medical professionals (e.g., doctors, nurses, researchers)** and **administrators** who need to analyze and interact with medical data.\n\nExpected characteristics:\n* **Medical Professionals:** Familiar with medical terminology and concepts, possibly less technically savvy but proficient in using web applications for data analysis.\n* **Administrators:** Familiar with system management, user access control, and potentially data reporting.\n* **General Web Proficiency:** All users are expected to have basic computer literacy and experience using modern web browsers.\n\n## 2.4. Constraints\n\n* **Technology Stack:** The frontend will be developed using **React.js** and its ecosystem (e.g., React Router, state management libraries like Redux/Zustand, UI component libraries like Material-UI/Ant Design).\n* **Browser Compatibility:** The application must be compatible with major modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and responsive across various screen sizes (desktop, tablet).\n* **API Dependency:** The application is entirely dependent on the availability and correct functioning of the **Medical System API** for data access and core business logic.\n* **Performance:** The UI must be responsive, and data loading/rendering times must be acceptable for a smooth user experience (detailed in Non-Functional Requirements).\n* **Security:** Client-side security best practices must be followed (e.g., protection against XSS, secure storage of tokens).\n\n## 2.5. Assumptions and Dependencies\n\n* **Medical System API Availability:** Assumed that the Medical System API is fully functional, accessible, and provides the necessary endpoints and data structures.\n* **Internet Connectivity:** Users are assumed to have a stable internet connection to access the web application.\n* **User Training:** It is assumed that users will receive basic training or access to a user manual if the application contains complex features.\n* **Backend Data Integrity:** The integrity and accuracy of the raw medical data are assumed to be managed and ensured by the Medical System API.\n"],"names":["_jsx","_components"],"mappings":"wpCAAE,SAAA;0CAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;wCAEG,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;;yCACI,SAAA,mCAAmC,CAAA,EAAA,uFAAA;yCACnC,SAAA,mCAAmC,CAAA,EAAA,8JAAA;yCACnC,SAAA,2BAA2B,CAAA,EAAA,4HAAA;yCAC3B,SAAA,uBAAuB,CAAA,EAAA,qPAAA;yCACvB,SAAA,uCAAuC,CAAA,EAAA,0GAAA;yCACvC,SAAA,qBAAqB,CAAA,EAAA,2GAAA;yCACrB,SAAA,cAAc,CAAA,EAAA,8EAAA;;2CAEf,SAAA;cAEH,SAAA,CAAA,+DAAAA,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAA8D,SAAA,4DAA4D,CAAA,EAAA,QAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAAO,SAAA,gBAAgB,CAAA,EAAA,sDAAA;aAEjJ,SAAA;;yCACI,SAAA,wBAAwB,CAAA,EAAA,8IAAA;yCACxB,SAAA,iBAAiB,CAAA,EAAA,wFAAA;yCACjB,SAAA,0BAA0B,CAAA,EAAA,mGAAA;;kCAE3B,SAAA;;yCAEC,SAAA,mBAAmB,CAAA,EAAA,yCAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAAwC,SAAA,UAAU,CAAA,EAAA,6IAAA;yCACrE,SAAA,wBAAwB,CAAA,EAAA,wKAAA;yCACxB,SAAA,iBAAiB,CAAA,EAAA,6FAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAA4F,SAAA,oBAAoB,CAAA,EAAA,2CAAA;yCACjI,SAAA,cAAc,CAAA,EAAA,yJAAA;yCACd,SAAA,WAAW,CAAA,EAAA,iHAAA;;mDAEZ,SAAA;;yCAEC,SAAA,kCAAkC,CAAA,EAAA,iIAAA;yCAClC,SAAA,wBAAwB,CAAA,EAAA,wFAAA;yCACxB,SAAA,gBAAgB,CAAA,EAAA,gIAAA;yCAChB,SAAA,yBAAyB,CAAA,EAAA,sHAAA;"}
