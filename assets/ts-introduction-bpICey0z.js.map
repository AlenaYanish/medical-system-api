Purpose\n\nThis document serves as the **Technical Specification (TS)** for the development of a **Web Application Postprocessor** utilizing the **React library**. It outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, design considerations, and overall scope of the web application, ensuring a clear understanding between stakeholders and the development team.\n\n## 1.2. Scope\n\nThe Web Application Postprocessor is designed to provide a user-friendly interface for processing and analyzing data, primarily interacting with the Medical System API as its data source. Its primary scope includes:\n* User authentication and authorization within the web application.\n* Displaying medical data retrieved from the Medical System API.\n* Applying specific post-processing algorithms/logic to the displayed data.\n* Presenting processed data in a clear and intuitive manner (e.g., charts, tables).\n* Facilitating user interaction for data filtering, sorting, and export.\n\nThis TS does *not* cover the development of the Medical System API itself (which is assumed to be an existing or separately developed backend service), nor does it detail the underlying server infrastructure beyond its direct impact on web application performance.\n\n## 1.3. Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations\n\n* **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.\n* **Web Application Postprocessor:** The front-end application developed using React, responsible for data retrieval, post-processing, and visualization.\n* **API:** Application Programming Interface (specifically, the Medical System API).\n* **TS:** Technical Specification\n* **SRS:** Software Requirement Specification\n* **UI:** User Interface\n* **UX:** User Experience\n* **JSON:** JavaScript Object Notation\n* **HTTP/S:** Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure)\n\n## 1.4. References\n\n* React Documentation: [https://react.dev/](https://react.dev/)\n* IEEE Std 830-1998: IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications\n* ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148-2011: Systems and software engineering – Life cycle processes – Requirements engineering\n* https://github.com/AlenaYanish/MedicalSystemAPI\n\n## 1.5. Overview\n\nThis document is structured to provide a comprehensive overview of the Web Application Postprocessor's requirements. Section 2 describes the general aspects of the application. Section 3 details the specific functional and non-functional requirements. Subsequent sections cover interface requirements, design constraints, and other relevant aspects of the client-side application.\n"],"names":["_jsx","_components"],"mappings":"48BAAE,SAAA;8BAEC,SAAA;cAEH,SAAA,CAAA,+BAAAA,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAA8B,SAAA,8BAA8B,CAAA,EAAA,6BAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAA4B,SAAA,+BAA+B,CAAA,EAAA,kBAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,OAAA,CAAiB,SAAA,eAAe,CAAA,EAAA,8MAAA;4BAEpJ,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA;;cACE,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;;cAEF,SAAA,CAAA,gBAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,GAAA,CAAc,SAAA,KAAI,CAAA,EAAA,wPAAA;6DAEf,SAAA;;yCAEC,SAAA,QAAQ,CAAA,EAAA,qDAAA;yCACR,SAAA,gCAAgC,CAAA,EAAA,uHAAA;yCAChC,SAAA,MAAM,CAAA,EAAA,4EAAA;yCACN,SAAA,KAAK,CAAA,EAAA,0BAAA;yCACL,SAAA,MAAM,CAAA,EAAA,qCAAA;yCACN,SAAA,KAAK,CAAA,EAAA,iBAAA;yCACL,SAAA,KAAK,CAAA,EAAA,kBAAA;yCACL,SAAA,OAAO,CAAA,EAAA,6BAAA;yCACP,SAAA,SAAS,CAAA,EAAA,uCAAA;;iCAEV,SAAA;;eAED,SAAA,CAAA,wBAAAD,MAAAC,EAAA,EAAA,2BAAsB,SAAA;cACtB,SAAA;cACA,SAAA;yFACA,SAAA;;+BAEC,SAAA;aAEH,SAAA"}
